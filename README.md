# BlankPage - Social Web for Musicians and Bands
BlankPage is a social music sharing service for the Fediverse. Built for bands, BlankPage is a customizable home page for all your songs, show dates, photos, and announcements. 

## Build with Emissary
BlankPage is a small social app build on [Emissary, the social web toolkit](https://emissary.dev). You must [install Emissary](https://emissary.dev/installation) on a server first, before using BlankPage.

### Installing
To install BlankPage on your own Emissary server directly from this repository, just open your Emissary setup console, navigate to Server Settings > Packages, and add a new Git adapter that points to: https://github.com/EmissarySocial/app-blank.git

### Customizing
BlankPage consists of a new custom profile page (or, outbox) and templates for a handful of new content types that each band can post: exhibits, show dates, photos, and announcements.  After installing BlankPage, each musician can customize the colors, images, and labels used in their own profile.
